# Prediction-of-Burned-Area-of-Forest
The main aim of the problem was to predict the burned area of a forest according to different parameters like Temperature, Humidity and also by considering standard codes like DMC(Duff Moisture Code) and FFMC(Fine Fuel Moisture Code).Performed Neural Network in order to get better prediction result.
